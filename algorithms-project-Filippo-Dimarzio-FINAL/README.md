This app features three different string-based algorithms, accessible through simple tab navigation with a clean, straightforward UI. Tabs are styled in dark forest green when selected and grey when not.

It consists of three connected screens showcasing the algorithms: Most Frequent Element, Count Occurrences, and Count Vowels and Consonants, all implemented using linear-time algorithms (O(n)).

The app includes JUnit 5 tests covering both normal behavior and basic error handling.

The UI is built with composable functions using Jetpack Compose, providing a smooth and efficient user experience.
